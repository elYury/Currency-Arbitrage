## Crypto Currency Arbitrage Bot

### Hello there, handsome person!

I built an algorithmic trading strategy that trades on arbitrage!


### What is arbitrage?

I suggest you research this yourself, but the general idea of the strategy is to exploit the difference in price between crypto exchanges. Simply, find a large enough difference in price, buy the coin on exchange 1, transfer it through the blockchain to exchange 2, and sell for a small profit.


### What does this program do?

In short, when run, the software will go out and analyze data from 10 different crypto exchanges. Perform an analysis on market price, then analyze the orderbook, calculate fees, precisely estimate profit, withdrawal status and provide networks. The results of the analysis are sent to a discord server for the user to see. There are some quality of life features too, such as input of available capital (to see how much a trade would yield with the available balance), and finally a simple quick links system. 


### Does this program make money?

Short answer is YES. Although the profits are quite small, opportunities arise every few minutes to every few hours. Note, it will not retire you in the Hamptons, and you will need dedication to stay alert and take trades that appear. What can be done to make this program extremely worthwhile, is automation. Next steps for me is to connect to the exchanges and take trades automatically.
